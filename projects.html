<h3>Project Rollaball: Unity</h3>
<p>Working with Unity for the first time was not very complex to learn, 
with previous experiences through <em>Roblox Studio</em> and even 2D platform 
editors like <em>BattleBlock Theatre</em> it was pretty easy to get a grasp at the 
controls and to create a simple game with the aid of my instructor for the coding 
and other technical aspects about Unity.</p>

<h3>Project Connect 4</h3>
<p>Working with my classmates on the first game of my technical institute's year was 
very fun to help design and lend ideas on for both myself, and for my classmates who each 
were working on different aspects of the game, and being able to design token skin ideas, 
alongside coming up with some of the features was very memorable and fun to do.</p>
